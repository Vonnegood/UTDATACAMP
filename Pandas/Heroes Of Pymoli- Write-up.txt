Out of 573 individual players, we have 81% (465) males, 17.5% (100) females, and 1.5% (8) Other/non-disclosed players. 
Males contributed $1,867 to our revenue, yet individually the Other / ND paid a higher average cost on our items. 
I think we should start some surveys to see what our players would like to see in-game.

Our highest percentage of players fall within 20-24 (45% of total players). Over 77% of our players are in the age range of 15-29. 
Our highest spending ages groups (after normalizing) is 25 and older.
The ages between 15-24 spent the least even though the include a bulk of our players.

Our top two most popular items were sold 11 times which gave us ~25 for each ($50 total). 
On the other hand, the Retribution Axe gave us the most revenue at 9 purchases for a total of $37.
We'll send this to marketing so they can see what trends are behind the item purchases.
